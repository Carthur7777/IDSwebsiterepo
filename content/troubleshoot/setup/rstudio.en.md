<li>The first step is to install <strong>R</strong>.  R is the free statistical programming language and environment that we will use in this course. You can get a copy from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) [here](https://cran.r-project.org/)
just follow the links under ‘Download and Install R’.

<br><br>
<li> The next step is to install <strong>RStudio</strong>. Rstudio is an alternative front end for R, which many people prefer to use. It provides an R code editor, R session window, R graphics window and other information, all in a convenient integrated environment. You can get it from [here](https://www.rstudio.com/) at the foot of the page, under ‘R studio desktop’, or go straight [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download).

<!-- <br><br>
<li> R can be extended using packages. These are collections of functions and data that allow us to re-use code developed by others. We will be using many different packages in this course, but one of the most important will be the <strong>rmarkdown<strong> package. This package allows us to document data analyses done using R. The workshops and the homework will be done using rmarkdown so you will need to download and install this package in RStudio. 

To download a package in RStudio, first you have to open up RStudio. Now that you have downloaded it, you should be able to click on the RStudio icon in your start menu. -->
