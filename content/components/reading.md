The reading for the week will be released on the website on Mondays. This reading will consist of a mix of videos, websites, text and exercises. Some of the reading is compulsory and some is optional - this will be clearly indicated on the website. 

We will not have time to cover all the course content in detail in the lectures, so you should expect to spend time each week going through the assigned reading and making sure you understand it. You can ask questions about the reading in the workshops, during the student hours or on <a id="Piazza">Piazza</a>. 

In some weeks, there could also be an interactive R tutorial. This R tutorial is designed to help with your learning. They are optional and not marked.
