The course organisers will hold "student hours" from week 2 on Tuesdays. Student hours are a chance for you to ask your questions (or just say hi) to the course organisers. Attendance is optional and you can turn up at any time during the hour.

The student hours will be held in-person from 14.10 - 15.00 in Office 5409, James Clerk Maxwell Building, King's Buildings Campus.
