There will be in-person lectures on Tuesdays and Thursdays. In both lectures we will cover course content, examples and programming. **Our role is to introduce you to new tools and techniques, but it is up to you to make best use of these tools and techniques**. Programming is a skill that is best learned by doing, so you will need to take what you learn in lectures and apply this knowledge to the various activities and tasks that you are given in other parts of the course. 

Attendance at lectures will not be be used to determine your mark but you are expected to attend all lectures and meaningfully contribute to exercises and homework assignments.

Lectures are recorded, and the recordings will be available on Learn after the lecture. It may take a few hours to upload these recordings. **Think of the recordings not as a replacement for attending lectures, but as a supplement!**
