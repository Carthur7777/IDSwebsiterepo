    <p style= "text-align: left; font-size: 1.2vw; overflow:hidden;"><em>My pronouns are she/her.</em>  I am a Lecturer in Industrial Mathematics in the School of Mathematics with a focus on applied statistics. My work is mainly centred around the modelling of uncertainty for decision-making in applied problems in industry and government. I work across a number of application areas such as energy systems (e.g. assessing the risk of the lights going out), forensic science (e.g. what is the evidential strength of cocaine traces on banknotes) and assessing uncertainty in large computer simulators (e.g. in models of UK landscapes). The sorts of statistical approaches I have used in these applications have included the modelling of time series and spatial data and use of graphical approaches for representing statistical models. I am very interested in using statistical modelling to help people solve real-life problems -- a crucial part of that is being able to extract the key messages from datasets and communicate those to non-statisticians!</p>

    <p style= "text-align: left; font-size: 1.2vw; overflow:hidden;"><em>My pronouns are he/him.</em> I am a University Teacher in Mathematical Sciences Computing in the School of Mathematics. My work focuses on teaching probability, statistics, and data science to undergraduate and masterâ€™s students; with previous experience teaching hypothesis testing and research design. My recent research focuses on developing machine learning algorithms to improve the diagnosis speed and accuracy of identifying seizures in clinical records of electrical brain activity. Alike to many data scientists from a neuroscience background, I appreciate how human neurology and behaviour has inspired many modern machine learning advancements. I am passionate about the practical applications of machine learning and aim to educate and inspire others to develop research and models to tackle real-world challenges.</p>
