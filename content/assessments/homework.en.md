You will be assigned a larger programming task to complete in weeks 2,4,6 and 8. The homework assignments will be posted on the website in the week that they are set. These assignments will be completed __individually__, and submitted on Learn. You will need to submit either a html or a pdf file, so make sure you knit your rmarkdown file before you submit it.

Do the (optional) R tutorials which will introduce you to the datasets and topics covered in the homework assignments.
