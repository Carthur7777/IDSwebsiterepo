You will be assigned a larger programming task to complete in weeks 2,4,6 and 8. The homework assignments will be posted on the website in the week that they are set and a GitHub repo will be set up that you can fork. These assignments will be completed __individually__, and submitted on Learn. You will need to submit either a html or a pdf file, so make sure you knit your rmarkdown file before you submit it.

If you fork the GitHub repo for your homework, make sure that you set it to private. If your completed homework can be accessed by others then you are responsible for any academic misconduct that might occur.
