These weekly multiple choice quizzes will help you evaluate your learning continuously. These assignments will be completed __individually__. The online quiz with the lowest score for each student will be dropped. 

The links to the weekly quiz will be posted on the website on a Monday. There will be two links. One will be to an application that you can use to run the R code  that is needed to complete the quiz. You can use this link to work through the quiz questions alongside the code. When you finish, a summary table of your answers will be produced. To be graded, the quiz answers from your summary table __must__  then be submitted using STACK, which you can access via the other link, or also through <a id="learnidsstack">Learn</a>. If you do not enter your answers into STACK __you will receive 0 for the quiz__. As an extra check you can also copy and paste the hash code that is generated underneath your summary table into STACK. This is optional but it will help us check that you correctly copied your answers into STACK.
